# Paykit
A plug-and-play Stripe integration kit for modern JavaScript frameworks â€” starting with **Next.js**, and expanding to more frameworks in the future. This project is inspired by [Theoâ€™s "How I Stay Sane Implementing Stripe"](https://github.com/t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations/tree/main), which lays out the clearest approach Iâ€™ve seen for managing the split-brain nature of Stripe data and your app state. Paykit builds on that idea to provide a fully installable, framework-ready implementation.

> ðŸ’¡ **Quick Start**

```bash
npx paykit-cli@latest
```
The CLI will guide you through setting up a Stripe-connected project using Next.js. It includes:
- Full Stripe integration (checkout, webhooks, sync)
- KV store readiness

## Why this project exists

Stripe is powerful â€” but integrating it properly is often a painful mix of:

- Boilerplate code
- Unclear event flow
- Race conditions between webhooks and frontend state

## What Paykit does

- Creates and syncs Stripe customers with your user IDs
- Handles checkout session creation with the proper customer binding
- Provides a single `syncStripeDataToKV(customerId)` method to eliminate inconsistencies
- Responds to relevant Stripe webhook events
- Offers prebuilt route handlers and helpers tailored to each supported framework
- You should carefully read [things that are still your problem](https://github.com/t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations?tab=readme-ov-file#things-that-are-still-your-problem) even we preset most of them in your `env.local` file.

## What Paykit is *not*

Paykit is not a full-scale, all-in-one Stripe system for your entire SaaS or app.

Itâ€™s the minimal foundation you need to integrate Stripe safely and sanely â€” a starting point to get you up and running without wandering through Stripeâ€™s documentation desert.  
Think of it as the groundwork that saves you hours of setup, so you can focus on building what makes your product unique.

## Supported Frameworks (Work in Progress)
